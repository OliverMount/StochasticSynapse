# Stochastic Synapse

This repository extends the conventional  NEURONSs' `Exp2Syn` synapse model to incorporate stochastic vesicle release, providing a more biologically realistic representation of synaptic transmission. We provide seperate mod file one for  `NEURON` and the other one for `CoreNEURON`, ensuring compatibility with GPU-accelerated and large-scale network simulations.

We introduce stochasticity using a release probability mechanism, enabling diverse response patterns across targetsâ€”even with shared presynaptic input. The model can be used for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and integrates seamlessly with Python-based simulations.

This work is designed to aid researchers exploring probabilistic synaptic dynamics in both small and large network contexts.


# Simulation of Release Probabilities
## NEURON

The figure below shows non-overlapping voltage traces of 5 cells receiving shared stochastic input for different synaptic release probabilities (1.0, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1).

The above figure is generated by running the python script NEURONtest.py from the `src` folder as
`python ../scripts/NEURONtest.py`. Before running the python script, please make sure to compile the mod files in the `src/mod` folder by running the `compile_mod_files.sh` in the same folder (choose either NEURON or CoreNEURON (NOR BOTH) during the compilation).

 
## CoreNEURON

The implementation for the CoreNEURON is not as straightforward as that of for the NEURON.
